## 🧠 Problem Statement

In an age of overconsumption driven by advertising, fast fashion, and digital convenience, **consumerism** has become a major contributor to environmental degradation, personal dissatisfaction, and social inequality.  

We aimed to rethink our consumption habits and propose **sustainable, community-based, and tech-enabled solutions** that promote mindful living.

## 💡 Our Solutions

### 1. 🛠 DIY for Sustainable Living
Empowering individuals to **create, repair, and repurpose items themselves** — promoting self-reliance, reducing waste, and saving money.  
- Encourages creativity and skill-building  
- Reduces reliance on mass-produced goods  
- Supports a circular economy

---

### 2. 🔁 Eco Swap Fests
Offline or online **community events** where people can exchange:  
- **Goods they no longer use** (clothes, books, gadgets)  
- **Skills** like cooking, gardening, or tech help  
This promotes sharing, reduces landfill waste, and fosters collaboration.

---

### 3. 📱 Digital Destination
A centralized **platform/app** that includes:
- Marketplace for second-hand goods  
- Guides to local repair services and DIY tutorials  
- Consumption tracker to help users monitor habits and reduce impulse buying

---

### 4. 🧘 Minimalism
Encouraging people to:
- Declutter and focus on what truly adds value to life  
- Distinguish between **needs vs marketing-driven wants**  
- Appreciate non-material joys like time, relationships, and experiences

---

### 5. 📵 Digital Detox Weekends
Promoting **screen-free weekends** to break the loop of social media-driven consumption:
- Reduces exposure to online ads & impulsive shopping  
- Encourages reading, offline hobbies, and real-world interaction  
- Supports mental well-being alongside sustainability
